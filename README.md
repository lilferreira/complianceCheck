# Incident Report Compliance Checker

This is a bilingual Streamlit app that checks the compliance of incident reports written in **English** or **Portuguese**. It uses spaCy-based NLP, custom rule-checking, and interactive feedback to detect:

- Missing required information (date, time, organization, etc.)
- Vague language (e.g., "something went wrong")
- Whether the report is written in the past tense
- Inline highlights for clarity

## Features
- Supports pasted text or file uploads (`.txt`, `.docx`)
- Works in both English and Portuguese
- Shows summary table of rule violations
- Highlights issues directly in the report text
- Allows exporting results to Excel

## Demo
You can [deploy it on Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) or Hugging Face Spaces.
